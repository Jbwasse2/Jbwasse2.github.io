Weasel Bots (Steven LaValle)
======
For my undergraduate thesis I worked on a "weasel bot" which was a simple, random, bouncing robot. I was interested in designing a mechanical structure that goes around the weasel bot that allows it to connect with other weasel bots. The ultimate goal in this project was to study what tasks can be accomplished through minimal sensing including pushing an object and having the robots join together in a configuration.

This project resulted in a publication at MRS 2018 and also allowed me to open source a python package that was more efficient than SciPy at solving a system of equations when the equations were represented through a sparse Kronecker product.

Yaskawa (Industrial Robots)
======
At Yaskawa the applications engineering teams are responsible for making [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3XyDLbaUmU) [cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQB9AAZJluw) [robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F4-plhdnj0) [demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-bw1PujfwQ). On this team I helped develop a motion planning library used for various applications of industrial robots.

I mostly ran my code on the following gantry robot in the thumbnail that was presented at a trade show.

Another system that I would test my code on was a robot arm demo that was designed to use its suction cups to grasp onto blocks from the green conveyor belt and pack them into a square on the white conveyor belt.

A cool extension of the prototype gantry robot was on a gigantic 3D printer that I helped a customer debug. The final demo of this project had the gantries 3D print a boat.

I have some further experience with factory robotics from when I did a separate internship at a plastic injection molding factory. That experience gave me some good experience in human-robotic interactions in an industrial setting as well as some insight into the lack of computer vision in industrial robotics processes.

BattleBots
======
During my Freshman and Sophomore year of college I was involved in the battlebots competitions. During my Freshman year I assisted with the machining, CAD, and some of the basic electronics for a battlebot that ultimately [failed to run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUQY5pSI5T0). During my Sophomore year I was head of electronics for the robot "Who Do You Know Here" which failed to run due to the weapon motor breaking. This robot got destroyed so badly that to this day the local battlebots club uses it in their promo videos.

Arity
======
At Arity I was responsible for creating a robotics demo that could help visualize the sensor readings from a car. For example, in this project the Stewart Platform would tilt backwords when the car was accelerating, forward when the car was deaccelerating, and to the side when turning. This tilt would also be affected by the speed of the car.

Robotics Outreach (FLL/FTC/FRC)
======
I am very passionate about outreach as I didn't have the opportunity to get involved in robotics until I got to UIUC. I previously mentored middle school aged students in FLL. I then went on to help expand the university's robotics outreach program to the local high schools to facilitate the creation and mentoring of the local FTC and FRC teams. I was also a judge for some local and regional FLL tournaments.
