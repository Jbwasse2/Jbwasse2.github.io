I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC. I am advised by [Girish Chowdhary](http://daslab.illinois.edu/). Recently, I have been working closely with [Unnat Jain](https://unnat.github.io/) in order to improve embodied AI tasks and apply them to real world robots.

Previously, I also did my undergraduate at UIUC where I completed my undergraduate thesis under the advising of [Steven LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/) and [Alli Nilles](https://alli.nilles.info/).
