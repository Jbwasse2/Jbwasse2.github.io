At Arity I was responsible for creating a robotics demo that could help visualize the sensor readings from a car. For example, in this project the Stewart Platform would tilt backwards when the car was accelerating, forward when the car was deaccelerating, and to the side when turning. This tilt would also be affected by the speed of the car.
