During my Freshman and Sophomore year of college I was involved in the battlebots competitions. During my Freshman year I assisted with the machining, CAD, and some of the basic electronics for a battlebot that ultimately [failed to run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUQY5pSI5T0). During my Sophomore year I was head of electronics for the robot "Who Do You Know Here" which had weapon failure due to the weapon motor breaking shortly before its fight. This robot got destroyed so badly that to this day the local battlebots club uses it in their promo videos.
